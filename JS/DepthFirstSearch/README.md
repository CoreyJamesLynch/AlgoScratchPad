# Description

- Given a Node class that has a name and a list of optional children nodes that, when put together, form an acyclic tree-like structure implement a depthFirstSearch method on the Node class.

- The depthFirstSearchMethod will take in an empty array

- The depthFirstSearchMethod should traverse the tree using the Depth-first approach, navigating the tree from left to right and stores all the nodes in an array to be returned after the entire tree has been traversed
