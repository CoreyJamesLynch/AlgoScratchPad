# Description

- Write a function that takes in a BST and returns an array containing integers that represent the sums of each branch in the given BST from the leftmost branch to the right most branch

- A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch

- A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node

## Constraints

- Each Binary Tree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node

- Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or none/null
