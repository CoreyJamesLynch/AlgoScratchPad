/* DESCRIPTION
Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
For example, there are n = 7 socks with colors ar = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.
*/

/* OBJECTIVES
Create function sockMerchant
Pass sockMerchant two params; n = ar.length, ar= arr of nums, each num a color
Return sum of matching color pairs
*/

// SOLUTION
const sockMerchant = (n, arr) => {
  const testArr = [];
  testArr.push(n, arr);
  return testArr;
}

// TESTS
console.log(sockMerchant(9, [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20]))
// -> 3

/* CONSTRAINTS
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= ar[i] <= 100 where 0 <= i < n
