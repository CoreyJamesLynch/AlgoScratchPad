# SUMMARY

- Return the sum of the integers in an input array.

## OBJECTIVES

- aVeryBigSum should take in is an array of integers, largeNumbers
- aVeryBigSum should return the sum of the integers in largeNumbers
- largeNumbers will have no more than 10 or no less than 1 ints
- each int in largeNumbers will be no less than 0 or more than 10000000000

## EXAMPLE

- largeNumber = [1000000001, 1000000002,
  1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]

- aVeryBigSum(largeNumber) -> 5000000015

- 1000000001 + 1000000002 + 1000000003 + 1000000004 + 1000000005 = 5000000015
